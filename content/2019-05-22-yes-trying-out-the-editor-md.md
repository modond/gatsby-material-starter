I want to try and create a new post with the editor, Yay! I can access it, I updated the config file to go to the right repo, namely one that i control after forking the gatsby material starter.



Hope this set up will make me happy, so far I am now looking at tweaking the material design to design my app/site in Sketch. Need to do a quick update on Sketch. I do have the Sketch handbook (jay) which I am now really using. After that handing it off to .. myself to code the scss for the material design for web.
